#summary Plans for article on RL. What to write about, what algorithms use and what to benchmark.

= Reinforcement learning article TODO =

to be filled... I hope :)

== Benchmarks ==

  * Compare effectiveness of learning and navigating in case of different number of vision sectors:
    * 3;
    * 5;
    * 7;
  * Compare different sector placements:
    * usual (from one point): central, back, front;
    * sparse (starting points of sectors are uniformly located along some line): back, front;
